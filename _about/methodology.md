## What is your methodology?

We call the methodology we use to build CollectionBuilder [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/). 

## Do you really need a "methodology"?

Not really. No. But as we built CollectionBuilder and other static tools like [Oral History as Data](https://uidaholib.github.io/oral-history-as-data/), we noticed that our approach was increasingly divergent from most academic library web development practice. Basically, we brainstormed some principles we were following, thought of a catchy name, and Lib-Static was born. 

## So what is Lib-Static?

Lib-Static argues that the systems libraries have been locked into, particularly concerning digital collections, serve neither the librarians/GLAM professionals that maintain them and prepare their content nor the collections we are trying to promote using them. 

CollectionBuilder, like other Lib-Static frameworks and projects, prioritizes pragmatic, sustainable, and simplified approaches to web development infrastructure, with a focus on leveraging the particular skills of digital knowledge workers in libraries and museums, empowering them to take control of their web systems.
