### Homework

**Create a collection using the objects you’ve prepared**

1. Create a *new* CollectionBuilder-GH collection repository using the green "Use this template" button from the CollectionBuilder-GH repository ([https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh))
-  Follow the "Generate from Template" documentation: [https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/repository/create/](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/repository/create/) 

2. Create your collection’s metadata according to the metadata guidelines: [https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/gh_metadata/](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/gh_metadata/) 
-  Use the CollectionBuilder-GH metadata template: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uv9ytll0hysMOH1j-VL1lZx6PWvc1zf3L35sK_4IuzI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uv9ytll0hysMOH1j-VL1lZx6PWvc1zf3L35sK_4IuzI/edit?usp=sharing) 
-  Be sure that you’ve included the required fields, and that filenames and file extensions in your metadata match the filenames and file extensions of your objects--filename is case sensitive!

3. Upload your metadata to your repository: [https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/uploading/](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/uploading/) 

4. Add your prepared objects to the objects folder in your repository: [https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/objects/gh-objects/](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/objects/gh-objects/) 

5. Turn on GitHub Pages: [https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/deploy/gh-pages/](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/deploy/gh-pages/) 

6. Adjust site-wide settings in the "_config.yml" file: [https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/config/](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/config/) 

7. Create an issue on the dhsi-demo repository ([https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/dhsi-demo/issues](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/dhsi-demo/issues)) that:
-  Describes your collection, and;
-  Includes links to your collection repository and live collection site.

8. Ensure software is set up on your personal computer (you’ve likely already done this by now)! [https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/) 
-  Git 
-  Text editor
-  Ruby
-  Jekyll + Bundler
