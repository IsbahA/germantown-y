Refer to the [Theme File section](theme.html) for more information about customizing the various pages in your collection. The files discussed in this section will help you customize the website to fit the metadata that's driving it. 

**Each of these "config-" files is a CSV (comma-separated-values) file that is stored in the `/_data/` directory of your repository.** 
We recommend that you edit them using your text editor, but Google Sheets or another spreadsheet program (that supports UTF-8 encoding) will also work.
