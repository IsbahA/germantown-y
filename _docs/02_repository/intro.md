Now that your *development environment* is ready to go, we need to get the code and set up a CollectionBuilder project.

1. [Create a Repository](#create)
2. [Clone Your New Repository](#clone)
3. [Committing and Pushing Your Files](#commit)
4. [Generating Your Site](#generate)
5. [Editing Your Repository](#edit)

{% include bootstrap/alert.md color="info" text="**Note**: As of 2020, all newly-created GitHub repositories will contain a primary branch called **main** instead of **master**. Most CollectionBuilder repositories have been migrated to use **main**, however some older repos may still contain a **master** branch. We've changed the terminology in our documentation to reflect this, using **main/master** to indicate that you may encounter either of these terms used to describe a repository's primary branch." %}
