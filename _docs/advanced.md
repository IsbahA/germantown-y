If we get this far during the workshop, you all must have been amazing. That was a LOT of content. 

And basically, we've run out of time to add much more right now. We will add to the docs and workshop sections in the future with more advanced topics, but if we are here, why don't you ask us what you want to know about. 

Here are some suggestions that we could discuss, demonstrate, and, later, write about so you have references: 

- Workflows using GitHub for building multiple collections
- Customizing tag cloud pages for fields other than 'subject' and 'location'
- TimelineJS option
- Examining the Liquid Code that Generates any of the visualizations
