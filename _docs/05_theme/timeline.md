## Timeline Page
The Timeline page represents each year as a row and each corresponding item as a thumbnail. This section will let you determine which years are in the **dropdown button** at the top right of the Timeline page. This button allows a user to jump down the page.

- **year-navigation**: Sets the years to appear in Timeline dropdown nav. 
	- *Tip*: If left blank, these will auto-generate. (We recommend leaving this blank.)
	- example --> `year-navigation: 1900;1905;1910;1915;1920`

- **year-nav-increment**: Sets the increment at which the years in the Timeline dropdown nav are automatically generated. 
	- Default: `5`
	- example --> `year-nav-increment: 7`
