## 6. Uploading Your Metadata

{% include bootstrap/alert.md color="warning mt-4" text='*Note:* CSV metadata should be in UTF-8 encoding. CSVs downloaded from Google Sheets or exported from OpenRefine will have the correct encoding. However, Excel does not handle UTF-8 correctly, and may cause issues. The encoding "UTF-8 with BOM" (created by Excel save as CSV) will not work!' %}

1. **Get your metadata ready for upload:**
    - Once you've finished creating your metadata in Google Sheets (or other software), click "File" and select "Download as Comma-separated values."
    - Locate the metadata CSV you've just downloaded on your computer. 
    - Without opening it, name this file using all lowercase letters, no spaces, and no hyphens.
    - Example filenames: `idahowater.csv`, `hjccc_dev.csv`
2. **Upload your metadata:**
