# Creating a Table of Contents
The table of content feeds from the markdown of the history page. The bullet points are generated from heading levels (h2, h3, ...h6) Because the table of contents lists subheadings, the highest level of header should stay at level to (h2 in html, ## in markdown). Those headers will be in a bulleted list. Lower headers will be nested as bullet points within bullet points.

## Getting more technical 
[The table of contents](https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc?tab=readme-ov-file#generated-html) is a plug in designed by Toshimaru.  It's ReadMe contains further documentation on how the table of contents work. Styling for the table of contents is in _custom.scss around line 56.
